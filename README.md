# Module 14 Challenge

In this challenge we use JavaScript and Plotly to design an interactive dashboard along with visualizations for a Belly Button Biodiversity data set. The output visualizations include an interactive bar chart that displays the Top 10 Bacteria cultures found per sample, a bubble chart that visualizes the bacteria cultures per sample and a metadata display which shows the demographic information for each sample.

The app.js file can be found within the statis/js folder. In the main folder you can find the sample.json data, along with the .html file used to view the visualization in a web browser. 

# Resources used

I consulted the Xpert Learning Assistance along with askBCS (ask-310943) for help with slicing and reversing data and assistance in building the bar chart.
